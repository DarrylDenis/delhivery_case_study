Overview
This project is a comprehensive case study on Delhivery, India's largest and fastest-growing fully integrated logistics services provider. The study uses real-world-inspired logistics and operations data to generate insights into performance, efficiency, and customer behavior.

🎯 Objective
Understand Delhivery's logistics ecosystem using data.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, inefficiencies, and operational bottlenecks.

Recommend data-driven strategies to improve logistics performance and profitability.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (for querying structured delivery data)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Tableau / Power BI (for dashboards)

Optional: Scikit-learn for predictive modeling

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset mimics Delhivery’s core operations and contains the following features:

Feature	Description
order_id	Unique identifier for each order
pickup_time	Time when the package was picked up
delivery_time	Time when the package was delivered
origin_city, destination_city	Shipment route
weight_kg	Parcel weight
delivery_status	Delivered, Delayed, In Transit
vendor_rating	Rating given by client (1 to 5)
courier_id	Identifier for delivery personnel
distance_km	Distance between origin and destination
warehouse_id	Distribution center used

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key questions explored:

What is the average delivery time across cities and weights?

How does parcel weight affect delays?

What is the performance of top warehouses and couriers?

Are there city-to-city delivery routes with consistently late deliveries?

What patterns emerge from vendor ratings?
